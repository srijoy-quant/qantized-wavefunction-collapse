this paper presents a novel interpretation of the wavefuntion collapse grounded in quantumm information theory.
we propose that collapse is not triggered by observation itself , but by a quantized increase in a system's informational entropy.
Specifically, we introduce a threshold condition: collapse occurs only when the von Neumann entropy of the system exceeds a critical value, δIc, due to entanglement with the environment
This reframing allows wavefunction collapse to be understood as an objective, testable process driven by entropy flow, rather than subjective measurement
We formalize this framework using mathematical postulates and simulate its behavior in canonical quantum setups, including the double-slit experiment, spin measurement, and Schr¨odinger’s cat.
The model not only aligns with known phenomena but also makes falsifiable predictions—suggesting that collapse is conditional and occurs only beyond an entropy threshold.
This provides a new lens on the quantum measurement problem and opens experimental paths for validating information-induced collapse.
