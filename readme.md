## ðŸ§  Summary

This project proposes a new, falsifiable model of quantum wavefunction collapse based on entropy thresholds.  
Collapse is predicted to occur when the systemâ€™s entropy gain from entanglement exceeds a quantized threshold.

## ðŸ“„ Contents

- Full paper (`paper/collapse_of_a_wave_function .pdf`)
- Jupyter notebooks for three canonical quantum systems:
  - Double-slit interference
  - Spin measurement
  - Partial entanglement using controlled-RY gates
- Simulation plots and figures

## ðŸ”¬ Key Insight

> Collapse = quantized entropy jump.

Instead of being observer-driven, collapse happens at the moment when informational entropy crosses a physical threshold â€” measurable and testable.

## ðŸ“Š Simulations

Simulations were built using Python + QuTiP. Notebooks are fully runnable via [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

## âœ… Status

- Submitted to arXiv (quant-ph)
- Preparing for journal submission
